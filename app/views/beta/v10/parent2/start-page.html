    <p>If a pregnancy ends before 24 weeks, parents can get a certificate in memory of their baby.</p>
    <p>Parents do not have to request a certificate - it’s optional. It’s free to get a certificate.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why we're contacting you</h2>

    <p>We've received a request for a baby loss certificate.</p>
    <p>The main applicant has named you as the other parent of their baby. They would like to include your name on their certificate.</p>
    <p>If you would like your name on their certificate, we’ll ask you some questions. You’ll have 7 days to give permission and confirm your details.</p>
    <p>One certificate will be posted to the main applicant. If you would like your own certificate, you can <a href="start-page">request one</a>.</p>
    <p>If you decide not to add your name, the request will be cancelled. The main applicant may choose to start a new request for a certificate with only themselves shown as the parent of their baby.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">About the certificate</h2>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      The certificate is not a legal document. For example, it cannot be used to claim benefits.
    </div>

    <p>It can show:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>name of parents</li>
      <li>relationship to baby</li>
      <li>baby's name</li>  
      <li>baby's sex</li>
      <li>date of baby loss</li>
      <li>place of baby loss</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The certificate will not be added to your GP record.</p>
    <p>If parents have lost more than one pregnancy, they can apply for a separate certificate for each baby loss.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
    
    <p>You'll need:</p>
