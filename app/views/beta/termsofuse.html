      Certificate of Baby Loss Terms of Use
    </h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of recording and issuing a Certificate of Baby Loss is to provide comfort and support to bereaved parents by recognising a loss.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Who is entitled
      </h2>
      <p>You are entitled to a Certificate of Baby Loss if you:</p>

        <li>have experienced a loss under 24 weeks gestation (or 28 weeks gestation if your pregnancy ended before 1 October 1992)</li>
        <li>are at least 16 years of age</li>
        <li>are living in England</li>
      </ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">

<p>The certificate is produced following a self-declaration by the parent.</p>
<p>The certificate cannot be used as evidence of identity and does not allow entitlement to any services or benefits.</p>

 
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  How to report a change in details
</h2>

   <p>If your details change from those provided for your certificate, you must submit a new request with your new details. Once you have received the new certificate, you can destroy the old one.</p>
    
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Lost, damaged or incorrect certificates

<p>If you lose or damage your certificate within three months of your initial request, you can contact us to request a duplicate certificate. If you lose or damage your certificate after three months of your initial request, or there is an error on your certificate, you must submit a new request. </p>
